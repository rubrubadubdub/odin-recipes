    <p>As Craig Payst notes over at Owls On the Table, if you want to complete the look and dress up your new BFF with a little pineapple wig, you have to buy an entire pineapple and chop that part off. That's ridiculous and wasteful. You should obviously make a fake pineapple top out of modeling clay so you always have one on hand.<br />
    After all, you're going to be serving this a lot. That's the responsible thing to do.</h2>
