    <p>Big Blueberry muffins with a crusty sugar topping. A recipe I got from my Grandma. The blueberries and the sweet
        batter are fabulous together. Favorites of all who have tried them. Quick and easy, made with few ingredients.
        Remember to use paper liners!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li> ½ cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1<br />
            Position rack in the middle of oven. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray the top of a
            muffin pan with non-stick coating, and line with paper liners.</li>

        <li>Step 2<br />
            In a large bowl, cream together the butter, 1 1/4 cups sugar and salt until light and fluffy. Beat in the
            eggs one at a time. Mix together 1 3/4 cup of the flour and baking powder. Beat in the flour mixture
            alternately with the buttermilk, mixing just until incorporated. Crush 1/4 of the blueberries, and stir into
            the batter. Mix the rest of the whole blueberries with the remaining 1/4 cup of the flour, and fold into the
            batter. Scoop into muffin cups. Sprinkle tops lightly with sugar.</li>

        <li>Step 3<br />
            Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until golden brown, and tops spring back when lightly tapped.</li>
    </ol>
